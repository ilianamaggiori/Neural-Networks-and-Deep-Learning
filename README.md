#### Project 1: Image Classification on CIFAR-10 with Wide Residual Networks
This project explores image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It investigates how architectural changes in Wide Residual Networks (WRNs) and the use of MixUp augmentation affect model performance.
##### Key topics:
- Testing various combinations of network **width** and **depth**
- Implementing **dropout regularization**
- Applying **MixUp** data augmentation
- Evaluating on **CIFAR-10** and testing robustness on **CIFAR-C**
- Analyzing **confidence scores** of predictions
  
Based on the paper: [Wide Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146)
